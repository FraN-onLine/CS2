    "> Alejandro bought 5 lots with a market value of Php 500,000.00 last 2021.  The market value of the 5 lots is expected to increase by 30% every year.  Compute and display the estimated market value of the property for the year 2023.  Document the parts of your code using the text cell/section.  \n",
